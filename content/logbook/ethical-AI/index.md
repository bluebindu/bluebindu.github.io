Like a virus, ethical problems can infect the decisions and actions produced by Artificial Intelligence, leading to unintended real-world consequences for the humans who ostensibly should benefit from more fair minded processes within the plumbing of an unbiased, disembodied algorithmic process. But AI systems, as a technology, are an extension of the human body-mind apparatusâ€“like a spear or a vessel for water. 

As such, AI systems are forged by the human body politic within the fire of a collective consciousness (and unconsciousness). Given this reality, it is necessary to apply principled reasoning to such AI systems, lest we, at best, continue threading human bias in these systems, and, at worst, magnify and exacerbate, for example, racial biases that curtail the liberty of incarcerated individuals.

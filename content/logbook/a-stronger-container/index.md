At some point, the grosser (as in the opposite of subtler) practices fall away. There’s less technique, less doing, and there arises more of the ability to drop into the pure ground of being. But we all have to begin somewhere…
 
We are bio-electrical beings. Consciousness resides in every cell. The mind is in the body. It is literally true.

Through the practice of yoga, we develop the body-mind’s ability to handle inner intensity. And yes, body-mind, for they are a unified apparatus. 

A stronger container, without identifying with the content, the story, allows us to better digest experiences, to bring about the dissolution of deep emotional impressions, so that we may come to know our true nature.

# *Excerpts*

>The function of the ordinary, feeble means of knowledge is to
>make apparent some previously unknown fact. Therefore, these are
>neither useful nor capable of establishing Awareness, which is independent, undivided, and continuously revealing itself.

>As it is said in the *Trikasāra* (‘The Essence of the Trinity’):
>‘If a person desires to step on the shadow of his head
>with his own foot, he will find his head will never be in the
>same place of his foot. The power of the Point is similar.’

>—*Pratyabhijñāhṛdayam* (Tr. Wallis 2017)

# Preface: My Era of Eat, Pray, Love

In writing this paper, I was reminded of the kinds of philosophical discussions
I had with a teacher at the foothills of the Himalayas in northern India. Every
day was the same. Before sunrise we participated in *pūjā* (ritual offerings),
wrapped in woolen blankets. As the doors of the horizon opened, we meditated
on the banks of a rivulet fed by the waters of the mightier Ganga in the company
of cows that carefully trod around us like the river that flows around a rock.
There was a deep level of trust one had to cultivate by the water in those days,
trusting that a cow would not lovingly crush you while your eyes were closed.
After the daily yogic practice, I returned to the river to sit and contemplate.
Later in the day, I described the contemplation and posed questions to him.
One day he said, “Contemplation is not thinking, and there is no contem-
plation without meditation. Elevated human experiences are usually without
thought.” I know this from my own experience. In those contemplations by
the river, I invited a subtle intention—“I am willing to experience whatever
needs to be experienced in this moment”—and then let it go, permitting what-
ever subtle energy was percolating beneath the *citta-vṛtti*, the mental-emotional
fluctuations, to arise from a point of stillness.

See the ruins of Babylon: mud bricks lie clumped in heaps. They are faint outlines of an ephemeral empire resembling perpetually dissolving sand castles enduring a higher tide. We grasp at its former physical form like the subterranean prisoners of Plato’s *Republic* who evaluate shadows on a cavern wall. A vain replica of the glorious double gate of lapis lazuli (the original was stolen and re-presented in a far-flung museum) lies open to the northern horizon, where presently a new Babylon—Baghdad—is groaning beneath the tyranny of quotidian violence.

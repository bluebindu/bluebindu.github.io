He walked through the door of the high roof of our meeting place which overlooked tens of lighted crosses across the Ainkawa Quarter. I could make out a star-spangled bandanna which bore an American bald eagle, its wings spread from ear to ear, protecting a freshly shaven head. The shininess of the scalp reflected some of the full moon light, glowing around the base of his durag.

He carried a long black object over his shoulder. Through the midnight darkness, it appeared narrow and menacing. As he drew closer, the AK-47 metamorphosed into a guitar. In his right hand was a black plastic bag which rang like dampened church bells, the sound of glass bottles full of Heineken as he swaggered over to our table at the edge of the rooftop.

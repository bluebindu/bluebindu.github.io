At the onset of the financial crisis of 2008, somewhere in the world, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto was binding the chaos and the order, the private cryptographic key with the validation of the public ledger. Bitcoin, the timechain, and “proof of work” were born to secure a decentralized network and its digital property, not through the brute force of the bullet or the bomb, but through the pacific, electromagnetic properties of bit-flipping, of converting electricity into cryptographic computation to verify, to validate—all without any trust whatsoever in the network’s participants.

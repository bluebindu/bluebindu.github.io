Helming a sailing vessel is very much a meditative practice.  

In sailing we tune our physical and mental awareness to the flow of the sea, to the whimsy of the wind, to the sensations within the body arising from contact with the sailing vessel herself. We reach a unity point—sea, wind, mind, body, vessel—and then the state of flow arises.

We develop the elegant ability to be with what is, to respond in alignment with our essence nature. And when we are in this state of flow, of unity, we viscerally experience subtle signs from nature, gracefully adjusting our course, to remain in flow, to be with what is.

For me, this is yoga.

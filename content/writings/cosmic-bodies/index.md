E = mc². You may remember this from grade school that matter and energy are equivalent and that the amount of pure energy contained within even the smallest of objects is staggering. Now, imagine the amount of pure energy contained within the body-mind apparatus! It is this energetic principle that we leverage to expand and evolve&mdash;not that we need to be “better,” for we are fine just as we are. We need only to abide in our essence nature to experience that truth. But this can be an understandably Herculean effort within the context of deeply-rooted social-conditioning and a complex nervous system which triggers the body-mind into fight or flight mode on a nearly constant basis (i.e. anxiety, stress, false sense of separation and isolation, etc.).

With spiritual technology, we may come to expand our awareness of the nature of reality and evolve our state of consciousness, really the entire body-mind apparatus, to one that is more cosmic in orientation and thus far less contracted.

## reaching a unity point

Helming a sailing vessel is very much a meditative practice. In sailing we tune our physical and mental awareness to the flow of the sea, to the whimsy of the wind, to the sensations within the body arising from contact with the sailing vessel herself. We reach a unity point&mdash;sea, wind, mind, body, vessel&mdash;and then the state of flow arises.    

We develop the elegant ability to be with what is, to respond in alignment with our essence nature. And when we are in this state of flow, of unity, we viscerally experience subtle signs from nature, gracefully adjusting our course, to remain in flow, to be with what is.

For me, this is yoga.

## path of yoga

Before I traveled to Thailand and the foothills of the Indian Himalayas, the memory of my first haṭha yoga class as a teenaged college student came to the fore&mdash;the lightly-incensed gymnasium made smaller with dimmed lights and glimmering candles&mdash;a half-dressed, elderly professor sat in lotus pose—hands to heart center&mdash;he seemed to hover in his white pants&mdash;Oṃ&mdash;Oṃ&mdash;Oṃ&mdash;the breath&mdash;breath&mdash;breathe out&mdash;in&mdash;the body opening&mdash;discomfort&mdash;palms skyward&mdash;expansion&mdash;a wave of calm&mdash;undulations of existence.

I knew then that this was good. In my particular case, it was exceptionally so. Science is beginning to catch up with the positive impact of yoga for Aspies (those with Asperger’s Syndrome) and others on the spectrum. In the beginning stages, āsana&mdash;haṭha and vinyāsa&mdash;and prāṇāyāma helped to improve proprioception and access to an energetic state beyond anxiety. These early yogic experiences led me to enroll in university courses in yoga and sacred Indian texts.

In later years, I began to experience the potential of a more holistic and less fragmented yogic process, experimenting with more advanced prāṇāyāma and meditative practices. But it wasn’t until I began formal teacher training that a profound shift in inner expansion and deeper healing began to occur.

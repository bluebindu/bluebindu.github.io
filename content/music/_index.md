> There is a deep necessity for human beings to realize his or her unconscious. Humanity is not satisfied with just an upper layer of our consciousness. It is absolutely necessary to go into the unconscious and take it out. Music is capable of approaching mysteries and laws existing in the cosmos. It opens forces hidden in our souls which we are not aware of. Thanks to music, we can approach and touch them.&nbsp;

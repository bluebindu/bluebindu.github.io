In the opening line of the Odyssey, Homer very thoughtfully described his hero Odysseus, the titular character, with a succinct adjective: πολύτροπος (polytropos).  It literally means “much-turned” in the sense of having wandered or traveled far and wide. And he did just that for over two decades: the first decade spent at war and the second as a refugee of sorts attempting desperately to return home to Ithaca. But the ancient Greeks interpreted polytropos in a more metaphorical manner as well: one with versatility of mind, for which Odysseus was renowned. As a polymath who has lived and worked in Iraq, Mexico, America, and now Australia and engaged in various industries—economic development, film, music, management consulting, beauty, software development, bitcoin, and AI—the layered meaning of polytropos resonates deeply with me. At my core, I care about learning, creating, and sharing knowledge with others, for wherever I set sail.
